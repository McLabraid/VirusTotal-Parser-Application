Virustotal Parser Application 
Allows the user to submit files and webpages/IPs to be scanned by Virustotal and for the relevant reports to be requested from them.
This Application is entirely in GUI form.
In order to properly use this application, a user must insert their API key from Virustotal within the code.

It's also suggested to download the VT.png file, as it gives a nice logo and who doesn't like a logo.

If you find a bug, please let me know :)
